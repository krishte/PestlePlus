# PestlePlus
## Overview
PestlePlus is a chrome extension that works on top of the Pestle website (https://pestle-ib.firebaseapp.com/). This website has a list of questions from past International Baccleaureate (IB) papers arranged by subject. Pestleplus currently works for the Math SL and Math HL subjects, and its purpose is threefold:
- **Question difficulty** - To assign each question a difficulty and display questions sorted by difficulty
- **Related questions** - To display related questions in terms of content for a given question
- **Timer functionality** - To provide timer functionality so that studens can attempt questions with under real exam time limits. 

The Pestle website was initially scraped to compute question difficulty and related questions, the results to which were then stored in json files. PestlePlus therefore alters the apperance of the Pestle website to reflect the stored information. The following sections detail how PestlePlus carries out its three purposes.
